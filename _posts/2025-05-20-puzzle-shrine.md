Puzzle Shrine is an escape room puzzle game developed in Unity as the focus of GCU course CST-461: "Current Trends in Computer Science". This class revolved around a semester-long study of the use of AI programming assistants in game development. In the case of Puzzle Shrine, ChatGPT and Github Copilot were primarily queried for important code snippets (e.g. player movement scripts), brainstorming concepts for in-game puzzles, and instructions for accomplishing tasks in the Unity Editor.
