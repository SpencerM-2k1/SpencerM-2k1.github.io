Star Shooter is a twin-stick shooter designed as the focus of a capstone project for Grand Canyon University's 2024-2025 academic year. The player is required to defeat waves of alien attackers in order to progress to each subsequent floor. The first three levels are pre-made, while all subsequent levels are procedurally generated through the use of a Binary Space Partition algorithm.

Star Shooter was developed in collaboration with fellow GCU alumni [Jacob Aguilar](https://github.com/JAguilar03) and [Tracy Potter](https://github.com/TPotter293).
